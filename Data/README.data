# README for data files in this current folder ("Data")

1) cellmatch.rds (v3.2.1): cellmatch database downloaded from scCATCH
https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scCATCH_performance_comparison
This is curated database with the reference of https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220300663

    readRDS("cellmatch.rds") to read the data base.
2) file:///home/feng/Feng/hg/scravid/Data/Cell_marker_Seq.xlsx
cell_marker_seq downloaded from http://117.50.127.228/CellMarker/CellMarker_download.html

There are other type of markers too. 

reference: cellmarker 2.0 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9825416/

3) geneinfo.rds: this one is also downloaded from(?) when I did annotation. either from cellmatch or cell_marker.

4) data for single cell RNASeq data. Seurat Objects with cluster information.
    they are the links to the folder, in which I save the seurat clusters done by Erik.

5) data for doing BCR seq/IgSeq. They are links. I link them to the windows folder pjmaglione, in which I have the data downloaded from linux after cellranger. The I also save the rdata after I read the BCR data in R.
BCR_vdj.RData
    3/4/2023  (data processed in IgSeq_data.R
    
6) enclone, this is the folder holding the pool clonotype data for all six subjects. It is a link pointing to the windows MSI maglione enclone folder. That folder contains the data downloaded from theano /projectnb/keplab

7) scObject.intergrateMNN.RData: this is the new data that were done using MNN containing all clusters. They were generated in ../../scravid2, linked here.
