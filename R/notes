included in a common clone, they must share the same V-gene, J-gene, and CDR3 nucleotide length. Further, each pair of sequences within the clone must share at least 85% CDR3 amino-acid similarity by Hamming distance. The script to run the ImmuneDB pipeline with these parameters is shown in Code 2.

for us: identical CDR3 aa sequence.
